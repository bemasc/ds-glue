2.  Background

   The DPRIVE working group has been pursuing designs for authenticated
   encryption of recursive-to-authoritative communication.  Recursive
   resolvers could enable authenticated encryption most easily and
   efficiently if they received authenticated information about the
   target nameserver's configuration during the in-bailiwick delegation
   that precedes the direct connection.  However, there are several
   obstacles to this.

2.1.  Obstacle 1: Authentication

   Glue records in DNS referral responses are unauthenticated.  Parents
   do not generally provide RRSIGs for these records in their responses,
   and resolvers do not expect such signatures to be present.  An in-
   path attacker can modify or remove records in the delegation response
   without detection.

2.2.  Obstacle 2: Flexibility

   Existing nameserver deployments assume that the delegation response
   includes only a fixed set of existing RR types (NS, A, AAAA, DS,
   RRSIG, etc.).  These systems are slow to upgrade, and we would like
   to be able to begin deploying authenticated encryption without first
   requiring a significant change in these parents.

3.  Proposal

   We propose to convey glue RRs in DS records, enabling authenticated
   delivery of arbitrary RR types as part of the delegation response.

3.1.  Encoding

   To encode a resource record R, we first transform it into a DNSKEY
   pseudo-record K as follows:

   *  Owner Name of K = The Owner Name of R relative to the child zone
      apex.

   *  Flags = 0x0001, i.e. only SEP (bit 15) is set.

   *  Protocol = 3

   *  Algorithm = DSGLUE (number TBD)

   *  Public Key = The RR type of R, followed by the RDATA of R in
      canonical RR form ([RFC4034], Section 6.2).

   For example, this RRSet:

   $ORIGIN example.com.
   @ 3600 IN NS ns1
          IN NS ns2
          IN NS NS.OTHER.EXAMPLE.

   would be represented as the following pseudo-records (in C-like
   pseudo-zone-file syntax):

   . 300 IN DNSKEY 1 3 TBD base64(
         "\x00\x02" ; RR type = NS
         "\x03ns1\x07example\x03com\x00"
       )
         IN DNSKEY 1 3 TBD base64(
         "\x00\x02" ; RR type = NS
         "\x03ns2\x07example\x03com\x00"
       )
         IN DNSKEY 1 3 TBD base64(
         "\x00\x02" ; RR type = NS
         "\x02ns\x05other\x07example\x00"
       )

   This DNSKEY RRSet's owner name is "." because the NS RRSet appears at
   the zone apex.  The NS RDATA has been converted to lowercase as
   specified by the canonicalization algorithm.  These are "pseudo-
   records" because they do not appear in any zone in this form.

   Having constructed the DNSKEY pseudo-record, the DS record is
   constructed as usual, but always using the VERBATIM digest type
   [I-D.draft-vandijk-dnsop-ds-digest-verbatim].  Thus, the final DS
   wire format RDATA forms the following concatenation:

   Key Tag | Algorithm = DSGLUE | Digest Type = VERBATIM | Digest = (
     DNSKEY owner name = name prefix | DNSKEY RDATA = (
       Flags = 1 | Protocol = 3 | Algorithm = DSGLUE | Public Key = (
         RR Type | RDATA
       )
     )
   )

   This DS record appears in the usual DS RRSet, whose owner name is the
   child apex.

      QUESTION: Should we skip the DNSKEY pseudo-record, and construct
      the fake DS directly?  This would save 6 bytes per RR, but would
      lose the ability to reuse DNSKEY->DS construction codepaths
      (unchanged except for a new digest type).

3.2.  Interpretation

   Upon receiving the DS RRSet, the recipient will first verify the DS
   RRSIGs as normal, and abort the resolution as Bogus if DNSSEC
   validation fails.

   Resolvers implementing this specification SHALL reverse the encoding
   process to extract one or more RRSets, all carrying the TTL of the DS
   RRSet.  The resolver SHALL add each of these RRSets to the delegation
   responses, replacing any RRSet with the same owner name and type.
   Resolution then proceeds as normal.

   Resolvers that do not implement this specification will ignore the
   DSGLUE records due to the unrecognized algorithm.  Thus, these
   records are safe to use for both signed and unsigned child zones.

   As with ordinary glue records, records received in DSGLUE MAY be
   cached for use in future delegations, but MUST NOT be returned to the
   stub resolver.

3.3.  Special case: RR Type = NSEC or NSEC3

   Normally, the absence of a particular record in a delegation response
   is not informative to a resolver.  The corresponding record might
   still exist in the child zone.  To inform the resolver that a
   particular RRSet is nonexistent for the purposes of delegation, the
   zone owner MAY place an NSEC or NSEC3 record in the delegation
   response.

   As with other glue records, this NSEC glue record only affects
   behavior during delegation following (see Section 4.3).

4.  Examples

   For these examples, we define the macro "$DSGLUE(prefix, RR type,
   rdata)" to construct a DS record as described in Section 3.1.

4.1.  Out-of-bailiwick referral

   An out-of-bailiwick referral contains only NS records, e.g.

   $ORIGIN com.
   example 3600 IN NS ns1.example.net.
                IN NS ns2.example.net.

   These records would be encoded in DSGLUE as:

   $ORIGIN com.
   example 3600 IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns1.example.net.)
                IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns2.example.net.)

4.2.  In-bailiwick referral

   An in-bailiwick referral contains NS records and at least one kind of
   address record.

   $ORIGIN com.
   example    3600 IN NS    ns1.example
                   IN NS    ns2.example
   ns1.example 600 IN A     192.0.2.1
                   IN AAAA  2001:db8::1
   ns2.example 600 IN A     192.0.2.2
                   IN AAAA  2001:db8::2

   These records would be encoded in DSGLUE as:

   $ORIGIN com.
   example 600 IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns1.example.com.)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns2.example.com.)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., A, 192.0.2.1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., AAAA, 2001:db8::1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns2., A, 192.0.2.1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns2., AAAA, 2001:db8::2)

   Note that the differing TTL between RRSets is lost.

4.3.  In-bailiwick referral without IPv4

   Consider a delegation to a nameserver that is only reachable with
   IPv6:

   $ORIGIN com.
   example    3600 IN NS    ns1.example
   ns1.example 600 IN AAAA  2001:db8::1

   A zone in this configuration can use an NSEC DSGLUE record to
   indicate that there is no IPv4 address:

   $ORIGIN com.
   example 600 IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns1.example.com.)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., AAAA, 2001:db8::1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(*., NSEC, *.example.com. A SVCB)

   This arrangement prevents an adversary from inserting their own A (or
   SVCB) records into the delegation response (e.g. in order to observe
   the queries).

   Note that although this NSEC record denies the existence of any A
   records in *.example.com, it is treated as a glue record that only
   applies during delegation, so such records can still be resolved if
   they exist.

4.4.  Delegation with authenticated encryption

   Assuming a SVCB-based signaling mechanism similar to
   [I-D.draft-schwartz-svcb-dns], an in-bailiwick referral with support
   for authenticated encryption is indicated as follows:

   $ORIGIN com.
   example 600 IN DS $DSGLUE(., NS, ns1.example.com.)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., A, 192.0.2.1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(ns1., AAAA, 2001:db8::1)
               IN DS $DSGLUE(_dns.ns1., SVCB,
                             1 ns1.example.com. alpn=dot)

4.4.1.  Disabling DANE

   Resolvers check whether a nameserver supports DANE by resolving a
   TLSA record during the delegation process.  However, this adds
   unnecessary latency to the delegation if the nameserver does not
   implement DANE.  As an optimization, such nameservers can add an NSEC
   record to indicate that there is no such TLSA record:

   IN DS $DSGLUE(*._tcp., NSEC, *._tcp.ns1.example.com. TLSA)

5.  Security Considerations

   Resolvers that process DSGLUE MUST perform DNSSEC validation.

   Records published as DSGLUE have owner names within the child zone,
   but are signed only by the parent.  This makes them fully
   authenticated, but provides different cryptographic guarantees than a
   direct signature by the child.  For example, these records might not
   appear in any key use logs maintained by the child.

6.  Operational Considerations

6.1.  Publishing DSGLUE records

   In order for the child to publish DSGLUE records, the parent must
   allow the child to publish arbitrary DS records or have specific
   support for this specification.

   If the parent supports CDS [RFC8078], child zones MAY use CDS to push
   DSGLUE into the parent.  Note that CDNSKEY records cannot be used,
   because (1) the client cannot publish CDNSKEY records with the
   required owner name and (2) the client cannot guarantee that the
   parent will use the VERBATIM digest to produce the DS record.

   Child zones SHOULD also publish the DSGLUE contents as ordinary
   records of the specified type at the indicated owner name, in order
   to enable revalidation [I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-ns-revalidation] and
   simplify debugging.

6.2.  Referral response size

   When records are present in both ordinary glue and DSGLUE, the
   response size is approximately doubled.  This could cause performance
   issues due to response truncation when the initial query is over UDP.

6.3.  PKI and DANE for Authenticated Encryption

      TODO: Move some of this text into a different draft.

   Nameservers supporting authenticated encryption MAY indicate any DANE
   mode, or none at all.

   As an optimization, nameservers using DANE MAY place a TLSA record in
   the DSGLUE to avoid the latency of a TLSA lookup during delegation.
   However, child zones should be aware that this adds complexity and
   delay to the process of TLSA key rotation.

   Nameservers that do not support DANE SHOULD add an NSEC or NSEC3
   record denying the TLSA record to the DSGLUE, as shown in
   Section 4.4.1, to avoid an unnecessary delay.

   Resolvers that support authenticated encryption MAY implement support
   for PKI-based authentication, DANE, or both.  PKI-only resolvers MUST
   nonetheless resolve TLSA records, and MUST NOT require authentication
   if the DANE mode is DANE-TA(2) or DANE-EE(3) [RFC7671].  DANE-only
   resolvers MUST NOT require authentication if the TLSA record does not
   exist.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a new entry to the DNS Security Algorithm
   Numbers registry:

   +========+===============+==========+=========+========+===========+
   | Number | Description   | Mnemonic | Zone    | Trans. | Reference |
   |        |               |          | Signing | Sec.   |           |
   +========+===============+==========+=========+========+===========+
   | TBD    | Authenticated | DSGLUE   | N       | ?      | (This     |
   |        | Glue          |          |         |        | document) |
   +--------+---------------+----------+---------+--------+-----------+
